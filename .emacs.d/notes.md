List of things that I want for my emacs. This should serve as a TODO list and hopefully, should explain how I solve what I wanted.

# Wishlist #

## ido-vertical-mode ##

I have ido-mode activated along with smex. I would like, only when looking to open buffers and files that ido-vertical-mode is activated. Otherwise, the minibuffer should keep on using the horizontal display.

## Do some vocabulary checking when blogging ##

I blog using Mardown files. I am not that good in english. I would lik e a syntax checker along with a synonim dictionnary
