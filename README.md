# Emacs Configuration

This configuration is used for my little dev environment. I was
tired of having a too simplistic dev env and I have never been
really fan of any commercial IDE.

## Support

* Python mode (not ipython) shipped with Emacs 23
* Coffee Script Mode (at https://github.com/defunkt/coffee-mode/)
* Autocomplete (at http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/)
* Pymacs
* Rope
* YASnippet

## Requirements

* pip install pep8
* pip install pylint
* pip install pyflakes
